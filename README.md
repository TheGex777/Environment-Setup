# Kali Linux CTF Environment Setup

This repo contains two scripts for you to use.



kali_setup.sh 

This will download and install the packages that you will need for conducting recon on a Windows or Linux Host. It will also download external tools from Github and create a directory structure to organize all of the utilities. Run this script inside the /home folder before you use the second script.



kali_setup2.sh

Use this script to create a directory structure for the machine you are conducting attacks against.  You can specify the name or IP address of the machine and it will do its magic.
