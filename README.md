# Envirionment Setup

This is a bash script that I use before I perform any recon on a machine. It downloads my Cherry Tree template, creates directories to organize data, and allows the option to download privilege escalation tools for later use. 


Directory Structure:

Exploits - Used for copying exploit scripts found from exploitdb or the searchsploit tool.

Screenshots - Used for storing screenshots. 

Scripts - Used for storing automation scripts that were downloaded from Github.

Notes - Used for storing any notes you might have.
